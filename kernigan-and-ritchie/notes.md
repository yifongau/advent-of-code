# printf tricks

`printf` has a number of available substitution tokens, depending on the kind of
value you wish to print: %d for int, %f for float, %s for string,  %c for character, etc. You also can set the width of the substitution, for more neatly formatted data, for example:

`printf("%3d %6d"), x, y)`
